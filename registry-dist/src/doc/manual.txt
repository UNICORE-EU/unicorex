The UNICORE Registry server provides information about available
services to clients and other services. It is a specially configured
UNICORE/X server, so please make sure to refer to the general
UNICORE/X manual as well.

Multiple UNICORE/X sites can share a Registry, greatly simplifying the
use of UNICORE services. Since such a registry is vital to the
functioning of a UNICORE-based federation, you can have more than one.
