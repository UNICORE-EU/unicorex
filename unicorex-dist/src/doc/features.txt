Features provided by UNICORE/X
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The functionality of the UNICORE/X server is organised into "features", where
each feature can combine services, startup code and the like.

Features are enabled by default.

Features can be disabled via configuration. It is also possible to
disable single services in a feature.
