Mail support
~~~~~~~~~~~~

UNICORE supports file staging out using email. An existing SMPT server 
or some other working email mechanism is required for this to work.

The source/target URL scheme is "mailto:". You can append a subject,
for example "mailto:user@domain?subject=Your output is ready"

Site setup
++++++++++

Without any configuration, UNICORE will use JavaMail and attempt 
to use an SMTP server running on the UNICORE/X host, 
expected to be listening on port 25 (the default SMTP port).

To change this behaviour, the following properties can be defined (in
the XNJS config file). See the next section if you do not want to use
an SMTP server directly.

 * XNJS.staging.mailHost: the host of the SMTP server
 * XNJS.staging.mailPort : the port of the SMTP server
 * XNJS.staging.mailUser : the user name of the mail account which sends email
 * XNJS.staging.mailPassword : the password of the mail account which sends email
 * XNJS.staging.mailSSL : to use SSL, see the XNJS/TSI SSL setup page on how to setup SSL

Email wrapper script
++++++++++++++++++++

As an alternative to using JavaMail, the site admin can define a script
which is executed (as the current UNICORE user) to send email.

----
# mailto wrapper script, defining this will disable JavaMail
XNJS.staging.mailSendScript=/path/to/mail-wrapper.sh
----

This is expected to takes three parameters: email address, file to send and a subject.
An example invocation is

----
mail-wrapper.sh "user@somehost.eu" "outfile" "Result file from your job"
----
