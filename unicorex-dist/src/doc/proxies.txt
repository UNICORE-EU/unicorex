GridFTP support
---------------

UNICORE can use GridFTP client tools for stage-in/stage-out provided
the client uploads the required proxy certificate. The proxy cert is
expected in a file ".proxy" in the job's working directory.

==== Configuring GridFTP

Using GridFTP can be customised using two settings in the XNJS config
file ("xnjs.properties").

--------------------------------------
# name / path of the executable
XNJS.staging.gridftp=/usr/local/bin/globus-url-copy

# additional parameters for globus-url-copy
XNJS.staging.gridftpParameters=
