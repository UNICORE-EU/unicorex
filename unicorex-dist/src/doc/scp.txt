SCP support
~~~~~~~~~~~ 

UNICORE supports file staging in/out using SCP with username/password
authentication. The source/target URL schema is "scp://"

Site setup
++++++++++

At a site that wishes to support SCP, the UNICORE server needs to 
be configured with the path of an scp wrapper script that can
pass the password to scp, if necessary. 

If not already pre-configured during installation, you can configure this 
path manually in the XNJS config file

----
# scp wrapper script
XNJS.staging.scpWrapper=/path/to/scp-wrapper.sh

SCP wrapper script
++++++++++++++++++

A possible scp wrapper script written in TCL is provided in the
"extras" folder of the core server bundle, for your convenience it is
reproduced here. It requires TCL and Expect.  You may need to modify
the first line depending on how Expect is installed on your system.

------
#!/usr/bin/expect -f

# this is a wrapper around scp
#
# it automates the interaction required to enter the password. 
#
# Prerequisites: 
# The TCL Expect tool is used. 
#
# Arguments:
# 1: source, 2: target, 3: password

set source [lindex $argv 0]
set target [lindex $argv 1]
set password [lindex $argv 2]
set timeout 10

# start the scp process
spawn scp "$source" "$target"

# handle the interaction
expect {
   "passphrase" {
     send "$password\r"
     exp_continue
    } "password:" {
     send "$password\r"
     exp_continue
    } "yes/no)?" {
     send "yes\r"
     exp_continue
    } timeout {
      puts "Timeout."
      exit
    } -re "." {
      exp_continue
    } eof {
      exit
    }
}

Similar scripts may also be written in other scripting languages such
as Python.
