=== Support for the UNICORE RUS Accounting

XNJS can produce accounting data and send it (using JMS messaging) to the UNICORE RUS Accounting which is 
a sophisticated and production ready system. The rus-job-processor module from this system 
is included in the Unicore/X release. Note that this system is supposed to work only when the 
classic (Perl) TSI is deployed.  

Additionally to set up the whole UNICORE RUS Accounting, at least two additional components 
are needed to be installed 
(rus-service with a records database and rus-bssadapter that collects resource usage data from LRMS). 

Further information on the RUS Accounting system is available in its 
http://unicore-dev.zam.kfa-juelich.de/documentation/rus-accounting-1.6.0[documentation].
Configuration of the rus-job-processor is available in this documentation too, in the respective section.

Other components of the RUS Accounting system can be downloaded from the UNICORE Life project,
http://sourceforge.net/projects/unicore-life/files/[files section].
