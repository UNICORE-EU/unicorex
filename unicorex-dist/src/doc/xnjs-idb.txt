[[ux_idb]]

The UNICORE IDB (incarnation database) contains information on the
target system capabilities (like number of nodes, CPUs etc) and
allowing to check client resource requests against these.

The second IDB function is to define abstract application definitions
that are then mapped onto concrete executables. This process (called
"incarnation") is performed by the XNJS component.

=== Defining the IDB location

The IDB file is defined by the property "XNJS.idbfile", which must
point to a file or directory on the UNICORE/X machine which is
readable by the UNICORE/X process.

==== Using an IDB directory

While the IDB can be put into a single file, it can be convenient to
use multiple files. In this case, the property "XNJS.idbfile" points to
a directory. The information from all files in this directory is merged.

When using a directory, you can optionally specify a "main" IDB file
containing applications, resources, properties etc.  From other files,
only Applications will be read. A main IDB file is defined via
"XNJS.idbfile.main"


==== User-specific applications (IDB extensions)

Sometimes it is required to define special applications for (groups
of) users, and even let users define their own applications. This
means that the set of available applications differs between users.

User specific applications can be defined using additional properties, 
for example like this:

---------
XNJS.idbfile.ext.1=/opt/staff/unicore/*.xml
XNJS.idbfile.ext.2=$HOME/.unicore/*.xml
XNJS.idbfile.ext.3=$WORK/projects/apps/*.xml
---------

These paths are resolved on the TSI machine, NOT on UNICORE/X. As you
can see, they can contain variables (using +$VARIABLE+ syntax WITHOUT
curly braces!).  Make sure that the numbering is consistent
(ext.1,ext.2,...).

[NOTE]
========
Some UNICORE features such as brokering in workflows might not (yet) work with
user-specific applications!

==== Examples for IDB setup

Here are a few common IDB config examples

Single IDB file (default)
---------
XNJS.idbfile=/etc/unicore/unicorex/simpleidb
---------

IDB directory, all files are merged
---------
XNJS.idbfile=/etc/unicore/unicorex/idb/
---------

IDB directory, main file defined, read apps from all other files
---------
XNJS.idbfile=/etc/unicore/unicorex/applications/
XNJS.idbfile.main=/etc/unicore/unicorex/simpleidb
---------

IDB directory, main file defined, user-specific extension
---------
XNJS.idbfile=/etc/unicore/unicorex/applications/
XNJS.idbfile.main=/etc/unicore/unicorex/simpleidb
XNJS.idbfile.ext.1=$HOME/.unicore/apps/*.xml
---------
