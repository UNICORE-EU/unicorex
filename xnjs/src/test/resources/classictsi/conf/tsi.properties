# Configuration of ACL support is per directory. You can provide as many settings as 
# required. The most specific one will be used. The property should always have  
# the prefix 'tsi.acl.' then directory path and after '=' a value. The valid values 
# are 'POSIX', 'NSF' and 'NONE' respectively for POSIX ACL, simulating POSIX ACL 
# with NFS ACL and for turning off the ACL support. For example:
# 
# tsi.acl./=NONE
# tsi.acl./home=POSIX
# tsi.acl./mnt/apps=NFS
#
# turns off ACL for directory /tmp ('/' is the most specific), turns POSIX ACL for 
# everything under /home and NFS ACL for everything under /mnt/apps. 
# Warning! Do not use symbolic links or .. or . - use only absolute, normalized paths. 
# Currently spaces in paths are also unsupported.
